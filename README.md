# Stopwatch Application (Tkinter-based)

This is a simple yet functional **Stopwatch** application built using Python and Tkinter. It features a user-friendly graphical interface and supports timing in **hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds**. The stopwatch allows you to **start** and **stop** the timer with ease, making it ideal for use in activities such as time tracking, experiments, or simple timekeeping.

## Key Features:
- **Start/Stop Timer:** Easily start or stop the timer with a button press.
- **Real-Time Display:** The elapsed time is updated every 10 milliseconds, showing hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **Simple and Clean Interface:** A minimalist design with large, readable font for clear time tracking.
- **Efficient Use of Tkinter:** Built with Python's Tkinter library for GUI development, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## How to Use:
1. Click on the **Start Timer** button to begin timing. The timer will start from `00:00:00:000`.
2. The timer will continue to update in real-time, showing hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
3. Click on the **Stop Timer** button to stop the timer, freezing the time at the point where it was stopped.
4. The time is continuously updated every 10 milliseconds when the timer is running.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the `stopwatch.py` file using Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stopwatch-tkinter.git
cd stopwatch-tkinter
